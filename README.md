# Periphery-Uncertainty-and-Legacy
The paper discusses intercity networks within the former Soviet Union region (FSU), semi-periphery of the global economic system of interactions. Intercity networks are constructed following an assumption that the interaction between offices of the same corporation indicates connectivity between cities. In the FSU, structures of global corporations are determined by continuous uncertainty. Consequently, it is possible to estimate temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of uncertainty through the evolving structures of the global companies drawing on the case of global advanced producer service (APS) companies which are considered as brokers, integrating the region into the global business structures. The dataset comprises structures of the APS firms within the region in 2015 and 2018. Comparing two networks present in 2015 and 2018, authors demonstrate temporal dynamics of network re—Åonfiguration and unequal spatial distribution of corporate offices in uncertain conditions. Through the lens of the network transformation, the continuous restructuring and peripheralization of the region are revealed.
